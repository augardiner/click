# Click

Click makes it easy to track your musical progression and practice habits, as you should **always** practice with a metronome! 

This is a project sparked by an actual problem I had, in that I could never remember what tempo I left off practicing guitar exercises at. Rather than driving to Staples and buying a notebook, I decided to put some skills to work and build a way more fun solution!
